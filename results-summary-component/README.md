## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this challenge I really struggled with the layout. I was trying to use vanilla CSS only, but then I started using Flexbox and manage do advance.  
The alignment of the list contents was a good test of my skills.

### Continued development

I think I can continue to improve on modern layout techniques such as Flexbox and Grid.
