## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This challenge was tough :)
It was the most complex layout I have implemented so far, coming with a page dedicated to the design system on the figma file. The difference between the desktop and mobile/tablet versions on the header also gave me some headaches (no pun intended). I ended up not using the mobile hero image on the header, and just gluing together the other ones with the grid.

### Continued development

I see I can still improve a lot on my layout skills, especially when it comes to responsiveness.
