## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Using the responsive CSS properties makes everything a breeze :)
Also done using the new Figma Dev Mode, which makes everything much more of a breeze.

### Continued development

I would like to tackle more complex challenges involving responsive layout.
