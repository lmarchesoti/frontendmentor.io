## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I had a lot of fun applying my new knowledge about landing page structure and CSS helper classes.
The image positioning and loading was a lot of work!

### Continued development

I still need to work on these skills, especially the responsive image skills!
