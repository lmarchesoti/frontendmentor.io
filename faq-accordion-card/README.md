## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I had a really tough time with the responsive desktop image. Coordinating the resizing and positioning of 3 images, as well as the complex overlapping they show on the left, was no easy task. It took me DAYS!!! XD

But now my image positioning muscles are much stronger, and I won the mobile version with little effort :)

### Continued development

This was a really tough project in terms of working with images. I know background images are still a nightmare to me, but I wonder if I'm still so far away from overcoming image sizing and positioning.
