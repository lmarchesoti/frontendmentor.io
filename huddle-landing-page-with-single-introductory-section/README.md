## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I had to use Icons for the first time, which was great :)

### Continued development

The entire process of aligning the background with the layout is a bit weird. I hope I improve on this for the next challenges.
