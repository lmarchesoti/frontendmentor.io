## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge was awesome to improve my responsive layout skills!  
Using two background images was definitely new.

### Continued development

I can still improve on responsive layout skills.  
I could also improve on those inner alignments. I guess improving my mastery of more traditional properties such as _vertical-alignment_ and _float_ will go a long way.
