## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I think this project was the first I had to work with a hero image on top. The more intricate layout of the plan details also made me give more value to those small parts of the layout that also need to look good.

### Continued development

I'd like to advance my layout skills and tackle more difficult challenges. Learning more about the patterns used for those micro layouts is also something I look forward to.
