## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

On this project I really focused on fluid layouts. I guess I got pretty close to perfect with it, but I still struggle a bit to get things working, and the problems that arise are always new.

### Continued development

I guess I can continue improving on fluid layout techniques, and also on code organization.
I tried separating things a bit more, but I think it ended up being a little too confusing. I might try clumping together more related CSS instead of leaving it here and there.
